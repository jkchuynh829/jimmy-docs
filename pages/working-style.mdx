# How to Best Work with Jimmy

## Introduction

This summary sheet is designed to help new team members understand my working style and preferences, ensuring a smooth
and effective collaboration. I believe that open communication and understanding each other's unique traits can lead to
a more productive and enjoyable working environment.

Personality Type: For the Myers-Briggs fans out there, I am an INTJ. This means I value logic and efficiency, and enjoy
working independently or in small, focused groups. INTJs are analytical, strategic thinkers who are highly efficient and
independent. They value logic, objectivity, and innovative problem-solving. For me, these things are mostly true.
Though, like many people, some days I might express my personality differently—I've also been categorized infrequently
as an INTF and even less infrequently an ENTJ.

## Giving and Receiving Feedback:

-   When giving feedback, I prefer to provide constructive criticism with specific examples and suggestions for
    improvement. I make best efforts to address a specific action and its result, especially if the feedback is critical
    in nature. On the other hand, I enjoy giving praise and look out for opportunties to give shout-outs when there is a
    clear impact.
-   When receiving feedback, I appreciate the same approach—honest and direct communication with a focus on actionable
    improvements. I appreciate receiving praise as much as giving it, whether public or private. I understand how good
    it can feel for others to recognize your hard work, which is why I also love giving others' their kudos.

## Best Contact Methods:

This depends a lot on team processes, but I have some preferences when it comes to contact methods depending on urgency.

-   For urgent matters, hopefully there's an assigned on-call engineer to field serious issues or service interruptions.
    In these cases, I make myself available directly via my phone. If you're familiar with something like PagerDuty, I
    set up notification and alerts via my mobile device to receive calls when urgent errors arise.
-   For less urgent matters, I prefer to prevent context switching both for others and myself as much as possible. In
    these cases, communicating asynchronously usually works best. During my work hours, I usually respond to Slack
    messages within an hour (usually less) and emails within a few hours.
-   For longer discussions or brainstorming sessions, I prefer scheduling a meeting or video call.

## Collaboration Tips:

-   Decision-making. I appreciate a data-driven approach, considering the pros and cons of each option before making a
    decision.
-   Project management. I thrive in organized environments and prefer using tools like Click Up or Asana to track tasks
    and deadlines. I value both quality and predictability when it comes to project delivery and deadlines, often opting
    more granular tasks over large deliveriables.
-   Flexibility and adaptability. I understand that plans can change, and I'm always open to adjusting our approach
    based on new information or priorities. I strongly believe in over-communication when it comes to adjusting scope
    and deadlines.

In conclusion, I believe that effective collaboration stems from understanding each other's unique working styles and
preferences. I look forward to working with you and contributing to our team's success. Please feel free to reach out if
you have any questions or would like to discuss further.
